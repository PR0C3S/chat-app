# Backend Technical Test â€“ WebSocket Alert Server





## Overview
Build a backend WebSocket and REST API server to support the Real-Time Alert Dashboard
frontend.
This backend must generate alerts in a specific format, handle real-time chat messaging, and
expose REST endpoints for alert history and manual alert triggering.
## ðŸ’¾ How Alerts and Chat Messages Are Handled

### Chat Messages
- Clients send messages via WebSocket `send-message`.
- Server broadcasts messages with `message` after filtering profanity.
- **Storage**: Only in client memory; lost on server restart.

### Alerts
- Created via REST (`POST /alerts`) or auto-generated every 10s (`generateAlert()`).
- Stored in server memory using a singleton `AlertRepository` and broadcasted with `new-alert`.
- **Storage**: In-memory only; server restart clears alerts.
